This project's Frontend is made using React JS library and Backend is formed by Node JS library.
Website data is stored in firebase database.
To accept the payment section I used Stripe library. 
It updates the data in realtime and also have the functions of login and signup which was made possible by firebase. 
You can add and remove products from carts.
There is a also a page where you can see the elements you have ordered but you can only see it if you are logged in
